In between going on neighbourhood adventures, I would often lose myself in books, something that hasn’t changed much over the years. At school, I tended toward the quiet side as a student, usually completing my work independently and spending my free time <Link to=\"/reading\">reading</Link>. By grade 4, I transferred into the gifted program and then eventually the <ExtLink href=\"https://www.ibo.org/\">International Baccalaureate (IB)</ExtLink> program in high school, from which I graduated in 2019. I was fairly involved throughout high school, serving on school councils, and participating in sports such as track & field, volleyball, and rugby.\n    </Text>\n\n    <Heading>technology</Heading>\n\n    <Text>\n      Until I reached high school, technology use was a rare priviledge in our household. Computers was used primarily for studying or working, and the exclusivity of it all piqued my curiosity. When I reached grade 7, my sister began a computer science course in high school. Having nothing better to do, I decided I wanted to follow along. From there, I discovered raw HTML and CSS. The webpage I made was crude and ugly, but it didn’t matter to me at all- I was simply amazed that I could control the pixels on the screen. From then on, I spent much of my free time on learning and gaining experience in software development. This experience came from all sorts of places: I attended hackathons all throughout high school, hosted workshops at my school, and worked on personal projects whenever I could.\n    </Text>\n\n    <Heading>up next</Heading>\n\n    <Text>\n      I currently study Software Engineering at the <ExtLink href=\"https://www.uwaterloo.ca\">University of Waterloo</ExtLink>.
