Some fault of it is mine, seeing as I haven't been reading nearly as much as I would've liked in the past few years. I think that going into it blind ultimately helped draw me into the story though. I was able to try and problem-solve alongside the characters when they hit upon a mystery and continuously speculate in my head as I read.

For me, reading science fiction is less about the escapism that comes with reading fantasy. Instead, it gives me a sense of anticipation for the future.

There are countless examples I could give, both ones that make significant impacts to the story as a whole and those that have next to no impact at all, but serve to make the story that much more believable and engrossing. One such example is when Cheng Xin and AA are looking to escape Earth on their spaceship. They come upon a class of children but are unable to save all of them given that their ship can only hold 3 more people. Cheng Xin is torn, horrified at the idea of having to choose who lives and dies, but AA acts quickly, choosing 3 children based on whoever can answer 3 questions/riddles. AA is quick to defend herself, saying \"I gave them a chance. Competition is necessary for survival.\" There is no clear superior moral choice here- it's just that, a choice.

For a reader who is more used to identifying or sympathizing with a character however, it may be hard for them to enjoy the novels as much. Throughout my reading, I often found myself not truly caring about any of the main characters at any given point, whether they ended up dying or living, what their future prospects were like. In another vein, the trilogy always had much bigger cards at stake and it felt quite silly to care about what would happen to a character like Cheng Xin when all of human kind was at risk of being wiped out.
