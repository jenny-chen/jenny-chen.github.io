Not because it was poorly written, in fact, for quite the opposite reason. The book is, at its core, a book about society’s unconcious biases against women, but was far more in-depth and well-researched than anything else I have ever seen on the topic."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The author brings to the focus an overwhelming number of gaps in data. A few of the situations that stick out in my mind include: the disproportionate ratio of unpaid work hours done by women, how public transit systems are too often designed by men for men despite mostly being used by women, and disturbingly high stats on women being mistreated in the workplace (particularly in healthcare, an industry in which many of my friends are currently pursuing a career in)."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"There’s a line in the book that resonated with me: “[Playing] along with the patriarchy is of short-term, individual benefit to women.
