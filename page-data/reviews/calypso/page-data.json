These two themes don't usually go to well together, for fairly obvious reasons. Sedaris weaves the two together in a fascinatingly intimate manner that ends up working really well though. Family dynamics, when written well, are always interesting to me, especially when it's as large a family as Sedaris'.

But there is one part of the book that threw me off a little bit and that stuck with me: Sedaris hauntingly describes the last time he sees his sister Tiffany before she eventually commits suicide. I believe it was the night after one of his events, he sees himself as the star of the night and feels qualified to deny his sister access to him when she appears at the door, disheveled and trying to hand him something. Security shuts the door on her and he doesn't see her again.

Her death was mentioned earlier in the story, glimpses of it seen here and there. This was like the final clue in an investigation. Like the reader has just discovered some tragic revelation. Sedaris manages to convey a world of emotion without having to write any of it down. So much of the book is absurd and comedic that the parts that aren't jump out that much more. Those are the parts that will stick with me longer.
