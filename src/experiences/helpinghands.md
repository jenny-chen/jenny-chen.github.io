### summary

Over the Summer of 2018, I worked with HelpingHands, a non-profit focused on helping connect students with local volunteering opportunities, on developing their webapp. It being my first "internship" of any kind, it was really an opprortunity to dip my feet in the world of professional software development. I worked primarily with React, on a search results page. Implementing this page included features such as pagnination and showing the locations of results on a map using the Google Maps API.
