Computers was used primarily for studying or working, and the\n      exclusivity of it all piqued my curiosity. When I reached grade 7, my\n      sister began a computer science course in high school. Having nothing\n      better to do, I decided I wanted to follow along. From there, I discovered\n      raw HTML and CSS. The webpage I made was crude and ugly, but it didn’t\n      matter to me at all- I was simply amazed that I could control the pixels\n      on the screen. From then on, I spent much of my free time on learning and\n      gaining experience in software development. This experience came from all\n      sorts of places: I attended hackathons all throughout high school, hosted\n      workshops at my school, and worked on personal projects whenever I could.\n    </Text>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default About\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
