The characters were all very similar, both to each other and I guess to Murakami’s usual characters as a whole: some vague, painfully average male, though there were some variation in ages, I don’t think it made a big difference in terms of their personalities.

More often then not, these were female characters. Now, this point has been brought up over and over again, that Murakami’s female characters are little more than just two-dimensional plot points. He has some well-written ones, sure, but I think the vast majority (especially in this collection) of them are not fantastic.

I think because they are written from a first person POV, it makes a lot more sense for characters to not be fleshed out. Multiple stories are focused around this idea of past connections being irreversibly lost, with time usually being the main factor. So it makes sense to me that these characters serve as nothing more than context, and I think I understand the “blurriness” that accompanied many of the stories (if that makes sense).

To help you get to a point where you understand something that you didn’t understand at first. And that becomes the cream of your life. The rest is boring and worthless.

Someday that love may end. Or it may never amount to anything.

Without that heat source a person’s heart—and a monkey’s heart, too—would turn into a bitterly cold, barren wasteland. A place where not a ray of sunlight falls, where the wildflowers of peace, the trees of hope, have no chance to grow.”"}]}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}},"frontmatter":{"date":"June 20, 2021","path":"/reflections/first-person-singular","author":"Haruki Murakami","title":"First Person Singular","goodreads":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54614599-first-person-singular"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
