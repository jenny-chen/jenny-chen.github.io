The sheer size of the world was a little overwhelming at first. I ended up reading it in two parts, taking a break to read a few other books in between. There's fantastic world-building and it's well written, but it was a little hard to follow at times; I would forget certain characters, mistake them for each other, and be generally confused. Personally not my cup of tea. I am undecided as to whether I wish to read the sequels. A good read for someone heavily into soft science-fiction."}]}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}},"frontmatter":{"date":"July 22, 2020","path":"/reviews/dune","author":"Frank Herbert","title":"Dune","goodreads":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
