As for maybe-boyfriend’s house, the hoarding was nowhere as compressed and restricting as certainly it was on those later TV entertainment programmes. There was no doubt, however, that he was adding to it. As for my reaction, I could bear the cluttered state of ‘Come in and welcome, but you’re going to have to squeeze a little’ during times I stayed over because of the normality of the kitchen and of his bedroom and the half normality of the bathroom. Mainly though, I could bear it because of the ‘maybe’ level of our relationship, meaning I didn’t officially live with him and wasn’t officially committed to him. If we were in a proper relationship and I did live with him and was officially committed to him, first thing I would have to do would be to leave.

Ma herself didn’t get depressions, didn’t either, tolerate depressions and, as with lots of people here who didn’t get them and didn’t tolerate them, she wanted to shake those who did until they caught themselves on. Of course at that time they weren’t called depressions.

As on the last two occasions of our meeting, that is, of his orchestrating of our meeting, this time too, mostly he asked questions, though without appearing anxious for any response. This was because his questions weren’t real questions. Not sincere requests for information or for confirmation of his surmises. These were statements of assertion, rhetorical power comments, hints, warnings, to let me know he was in the business of knowing already, with those tag-on ‘weren’t you?’, ‘didn’t you?’, ‘isn’t that right?’, ‘is not that so?’ appended for pretence of query at the end.

which meant, he implied when he made this second move on me, that I’d made a mistake in rejecting him first time. He said that although he’d come out with a lot of stalk-talk on that occasion in response to my rejection of him, he hadn’t meant all that ‘just you wait, filthy cat, you’re going to die’. He said he hoped I hadn’t taken it in the wrong vein but instead had known really, had accepted his words really, as expressive of his natural desire for my company.

Some too, would make mention of the actual word ‘rumour’, as in ‘Rumour says’, before going on to personify rumour, as if it wasn’t they who were launching or perpetuating Rumour themselves.

I’d launch my ‘I don’t know’ as the biggest player in my verbal defence repertoire and I’d be prepared to carry on saying it because another thing I’d learned by the end of primary school was that it was best not to open my mouth in the interests of truth except to a trusted few persons, this trusted-few becoming a trusted-fewer as time progressed in primary school and then I was in secondary school and by that time – age eleven through to sixteen – my trusted-fewer people had declined further so that by age eighteen – the time of me and the milkman as well as of this gossip about me and the milkman – it had got to the point where there was now only one remaining trusted-fewest person left for me to have faith in in all the world.

For all your so-called knowledge of the world, how come you don’t know that?’ I didn’t know what ma meant by my knowledge of the world. My knowledge of the world consisted of fucking hell, fucking hell, fucking hell, which didn’t lend itself to detail, the detail really being those words themselves.

Of course there was the big one, the biggest reason for not marrying the right spouse. If you married that one, the one you loved and desired and who loved and desired you back, with the union proving true and good and replete with the most fulfilling happiness, well, what if this wonderful spouse didn’t fall out of love with you, or you with them, and neither of you either, got killed in the political problems? All those joyful evers and infinites? Are you sure, really, really sure, you could cope with the prospect of that? The community decided that no, it couldn’t. Great and sustained happiness was far too much to ask of it. That was why marrying in doubt, marrying in guilt, marrying in regret, in fear, in despair, in blame, also in terrible self-sacrifice was pretty much the unspoken matrimonial requisite here.

Being loved back by the person he loved to the point where he couldn’t cope anymore with the vulnerable reciprocity of giving and receiving, he ended the relationship to get it over with before he lost it, before it was snatched from him, either by fate or by somebody else.

The normal women had been expecting, indeed dreading, that the issue women, once started, would take the exposure opportunity to harp on in a broad, encyclopaedic fashion about injustice towards and trespasses against women, not just in the present day but all through the ages, using terminology such as ‘terminology’, ‘case studies show’, ‘incorporates the systemic, transhistoric, institutionalised and legislated antipathy of’ and so on that completely these days these women appeared to be steeped in. There would be the injustices too, thought the traditional women, those big ones, the famous ones, the international ones – witch-burnings, footbindings, suttee, honour killings, female circumcision, rape, child marriages, retributions by stoning, female infanticide, gynaecological practices, maternal mortality, domestic servitude, treatment as chattels, as breeding stock, as possessions, girls going missing, girls being sold and all those other worldwide cultural, tribal and religious socialisations and scandalisations, also the warnings given against things throughout patriarchal history that were seen as uncommon for a woman to do or think or say. But no. Not that, which in the middle of a local curfew-break would have been bad enough. Instead these local issue women spoke of homespun, personal, ordinary things, such as walking down the street and getting hit by a guy, any guy, just as you’re walking by, just for nothing, just because he was in a bad mood and felt like hitting you or because some soldier from ‘over the water’ had given him a hard time so now it was your turn to have the hard time so he hits you. Or having your bum felt as you’re walking along. Or having loud male comment passed upon your physical characteristics as you’re passing. Or getting molested in the snow under the guise of some nice friendly snowfight. Or getting hang-ups in the summer about the summer because if you didn’t wear much clothes because it was warm, if you wore a little dress, that would bring upon you all that general summertime street harassment.

Then there was menstruation and how it was seen as an affront to being a person. And pregnancy too, how that couldn’t be helped but all the same, an affront to being a person. Then they spoke about ordinary physical violence as if it wasn’t just normal violence, also speaking of how getting your blouse ripped off in a physical fight, or your brassiere ripped off in a physical fight, or getting felt up in a fight wasn’t violence that was physical so much as it was sexual even if, they said, you were supposed to pretend the bra and the breast had been incidental to the physical violence and not the disguised point of the physical violence, making it sexual violence all along.
