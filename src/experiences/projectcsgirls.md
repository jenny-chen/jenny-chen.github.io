### summary

As an executive and event coordinator on our local branch of ProjectCSGirls, I organized multiple programming workshops for local elementary school girls. These workshops were meant to encourage girls to seek and pursue education in STEM subjects, where women are traditionally underrepresented. 

Other tasks I performed during this time included coordinating with school administration and parents about the logistics of our events, creating the programming curriculum for the workshops (focused primarily around web dev as visual activities helped engage the children for longer), and teaching content during the workshops.
