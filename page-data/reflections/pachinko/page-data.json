It’s not a book that holds a plot at all, it simply follows the lives of the family, but the prose and the scenes it describes are very well written. Additionally, I personally found the story particularly intriguing because of how little I knew about the history between Korea and Japan. I was completely unaware that there is still a fairly large community of Koreans living in Japan now, remnants of Japan’s colonization of Korea. It’s not enough to learn history just through reading novels of course, but I feel that I definitely learned quite a bit."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Receommended read for those who enjoy historical fiction, learning about Korean/Japanese history.
