### summary

I interned at Jewlr as a Fullstack Intern for the Summer of 2020. Along with the rest of the team, I worked with React and Ruby on Rails to add to and maintain the Jewlr website. Earlier on in the internship, I implemented new designs for various informational pages, but later on took on more independant tasks, such as refactored and redesigned old code from HTML+ERB file types into React. This involved writing new code in React to replace existing features as well as creating new Ruby APIs to communicate data properly on the backend.

Near the end of the internship, I created SlackBot, wrote multiple scripts and Google Cloud Functions to streamline the process of creating and tracking issues between Slack and various project management softwares, such as Jira and Clubhouse.
