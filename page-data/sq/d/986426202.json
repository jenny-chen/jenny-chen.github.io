On one hand, the writing was, at times, amazing. It would draw me in and make me want to keep reading, or well, listening since this one was consumed as an audiobook.

I read both Never Let Me Go and The Remains of the Day a few years back, and was pretty captivated by his writing style: calm, yet still extremely expressive.
