I heard a lot about this book before I picked it up. The reflections I had heard were always extreme; either someone absolutely loved it, or they thought the book was just chock-full of useless advice. As for myself, I didn’t hate it, but it didn’t blow my mind.

While I believe much of the book does reiterate some “common sense” ideas, I did get some value out of it just by reading them again.

The best lesson from the book was probably the line: you are not special. Believing that you are constantly a victim is equally destructive as believing that you are constantly a winner. The idea overlaps quite a bit with stoicism: concentrate on what you can control and change and don’t get caught up with the things you can’t.
