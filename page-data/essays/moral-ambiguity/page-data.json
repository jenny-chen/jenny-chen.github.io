I thoroughly enjoyed the entire thing, but there was an aspect that I particularly liked: the moral ambiguity of many of the characters throughout the books. But why? What is it about moral ambiguity that makes me enjoy reading about it? Of course, it's not just me. The popularity of morally ambiguous characters has been a documented cultural phenomenon for quite a while. This is especially present on television and\nin cinema where anti-heros litter the scene.

After all, it is their choices that drive the plot and narrative forward. As such, if readers are to truly become invested in the story, they may also develop strong attachments to the characters themselves, forming judgements and evaluations of them and their actions. In the case of morally ambiguous characters, these feelings towards them may often be hard to parse. This is when moral disengagement comes in. Moral disengagement is defined as \"the process where an individual or group of individuals distances themselves from the normal or usual ethical standards of behaviour and then become convinced that new unethical behaviours are justified due often to some perceived extenuating circumstances\""},{"type":"element","tagName":"sup","properties":{"id":"fnref-2"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#fn-2","className":["footnote-ref"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"2"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":["footnotes"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"hr","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"ol","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{"id":"fn-1"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/191024_crosstabs_JOKER_Adults_v2_EM.pdf"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/191024_crosstabs_JOKER_Adults_v2_EM.pdf"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#fnref-1","className":["footnote-backref"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"↩"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{"id":"fn-2"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"https://www.oxford-review.com/oxford-review-encyclopaedia-terms/moral-disengagement/"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"https://www.oxford-review.com/oxford-review-encyclopaedia-terms/moral-disengagement/"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#fnref-2","className":["footnote-backref"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"↩"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 26, 2020","path":"/essays/moral-ambiguity","title":"Moral Ambiguity","description":"and why we love it so much"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
