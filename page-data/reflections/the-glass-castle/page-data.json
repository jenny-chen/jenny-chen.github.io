My friend had mentioned that it was a rather “depressing” read and I started it fully expecting it to be just that. Now that I’ve finished though, I don’t think I found that to be the case. It’s another memoir that doesn’t come with any moral or real conclusion to be drawn. And to be clear, though that sounds a little negative, this is not a bad thing. Overall, I’d say I enjoyed reading it, and I have a few thoughts that I’d want to dissect further."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The first is a pretty surface level comparison: while reading "},{"type":"element","tagName":"em","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The Glass Castle"}]},{"type":"text","value":", I found that I was reminded very strongly of "},{"type":"element","tagName":"em","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Educated"}]},{"type":"text","value":" by Tara Westover.

Rex tries to quit drinking numerous times, and even when it seems like we’ve reached the climax, with him tied to the bed frame, screaming alone, he falls right back into it a few pages or a chapter later. There’s no fanfare, it’s not played up as a big deal, it’s just, oh, he’s drinking again. The same pattern can be easily identified in various other scenarios, often involving the mom as well, like regarding her teaching roles, their resistance to budgeting. It’s hard to describe the pattern succinctly, but I guess if I had to I would say that it seems like they’re just drawn towards instability."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"And though I tried to remain unbiased throughout my reading, I found myself passing judgement regardless. This is almost certainly due to the environment I was brought up in; I was raised to believe in values very much opposed to what Walls’ parents seem to live by, or lived by. But also now, having watched Nomadland, it feels like my thoughts have been re-jumbled (if that’s a word). What is one supposed to do in such a situation? Continuously offer help, whether it be monetary or through some physical gift? And there is never really any conclusion drawn, no closure to be had. I suppose, in the end, that it’s just “to each their own”, everyone should be able to live their lives however they see fit. And though that sounds like such a simple idea on the surface, I’m sure that’s much more complicated when it impacts your own life."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Obviously, I have a tough time even imagining what a life like that would be like.
